2018-05-08 10:21:40	Randolf	I know that in NetBSD it's possible to set the state of a NIC to "down" (or "up") in the relevant configuration file (e.g., /etc/ifconfig.wm0), and I'm guessing that it's probably very much the same in Ubuntu.

2018-05-08 15:51:26	SSMAdmin	Hi all.  I investigate how to make a VirtualBox VM autostart at system boottime in Ubuntu 18.04 (as a system service).  It can be ran headless, but I prefer to also be able to control this vm in the VirtualBox GUI. Asking in #virtualbox and reading the manual does not provide definite answers https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch09.html#autostart-linux  Anyone able to help?
2018-05-08 15:51:59	SSMAdmin	Or is there a better way to do it, using something else than virtualbox?
2018-05-08 15:52:01	Norux	Anticom: oh there's also `gnome-control-center`
